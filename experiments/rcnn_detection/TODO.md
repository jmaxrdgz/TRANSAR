- [ ] Allow to load custom weights in SwinV2 (and custom weights pretrained on different size input)
- [ ] Add freature to freeze blocks of the backbone 
- [ ] Train backbone and head with different learning rates 
- [ ] Log metrics and samples in tensorboard
- [ ] Make HiViT-Base backbone compatible with Timm (import from github)
